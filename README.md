Implement a game called Column Jump using breadth first, depth first and greedy search algorithms. The game consists of a square grid with different colored balls in each grid position. The grid contains a single empty position. The rules of the game are as follows:
  1. You can jump over a different colored ball to an empty space. The jumped over ball is deleted.
  2. If there are more than one of the same colored balls between the starting position and the destination empty position,   then all of those balls are deleted.
  3. Continue jumping from one position to another till only one ball is left in the entire grid and the remaining           positions are empty.
